**CodeDrifter** makes documentation **effortless, accurate, and always up to date**.  
No more stale docs. No more onboarding nightmares. Just clean, living documentation that evolves with your code.

## 🌟 Why CodeDrifter?  

In real-world dev environments, documentation is often:  

❌ **Slow to write** – Developers avoid writing them.  
❌ **Painful to read** – Inconsistent style, broken links.  
❌ **Quickly stale** – Code changes, docs don’t.  

This causes **onboarding delays, wasted time, and bugs**.  

✅ **CodeDrifter fixes that.**

👉 *Benefit: Developers don’t start from scratch. Docs are created instantly, then refined with small edits.*
